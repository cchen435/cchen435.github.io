    I am a software development engineer from Amazon Science. I am working on deep learning compiler and framework. 
    I got my Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology, and was advised by 
    [Santosh Pande](https://sites.google.com/site/profsantoshpande/) and 
    [Greg Eisenhauer](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~eisen/). Before that, 
    I received my M.S. and B.S. degrees from Hunan University (Changsha, China) 
    under the supervision of Dr. Cheng Xu (徐成).
    
    In general, my research interest lies in the intersection of compiler 
    and system. I am particularly interested in applying compiler techniques 
    to problems such as application performance and resilience.

      This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

      Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
