I am a software development engineer from Amazon Science, working on deep learning 
compiler and framework. I got my Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology, and 
was advised by [Santosh Pande](https://sites.google.com/site/profsantoshpande/) 
and [Greg Eisenhauer](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~eisen/). Before that, I received 
my M.S. and B.S. degrees from Hunan University (Changsha, China) under the supervision 
of [Dr. Cheng Xu (徐成)](http://esnl.hnu.edu.cn/info/1008/1271.htm)

In general, my research interest lies in the intersection of compiler and system. 
I am particularly interested in applying compiler techniques to problems such as application performance and resilience.

# Updates
- Dec 2021: CASE is accepted by PPoPP’22. It provides a scheduling framework for improving GPU utilizations.
- May 2021: IterPro is accepted by IEEE TPDS. It explores features of modern compiler optimizations for almost free resilience.
- April 2021: I joined amazon science working on deep learning compiler and system.
- Dec 2020: I defended my dissertation.
- Nov 2020: I joined amazon SCOT working on distributed storage system.
- May 2019: Our paper CARE is accepted by SC’19, and nominated as a Best Student Paper Finalist. CARE is a instant failure recovery framework. It incurs zero runtime overhead, during the normal execution of applications.
- Jan 2018: Our paper LADR is accespted by HPDC’18.
- Sep 2016: I did internship at VMWare CTO Office, Boston, MA.
- Aug 2016: Two papers related to active storage were awarded as Best Papers.
